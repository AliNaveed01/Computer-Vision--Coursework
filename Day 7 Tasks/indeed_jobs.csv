Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and inspiring stories.



UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.

UNDP is the leading United Nations organization, fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet.
 The Agenda 2030, based on a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is underpinned by a strong commitment to leave no one behind and to reach the furthest behind first. It recognizes the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and inequality and provides a framework that comprehensively addresses all dimensions of well-being. Pakistan was one of the first countries in the world to endorse the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the Sustainable Development Summit held on 25 September 2015. In 2016, Pakistan Parliament unanimously approved the SDGs as the national development agenda. Since then, Pakistan has demonstrated an impressive policy, institutional, and financial commitment to achieving SDGs, embracing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and leaving no one behind by adopting the UNDP-supported Goals frameworks as part of its national development planning. Since adopting the Sustainable Development Goals as the National Development Agenda, the Punjab Government took the lead in establishing the SDGs Support Unit at the Planning & Development Board in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme.
 As a second-generation intervention of the long-standing National Initiative for SDGs (2016-2023), the Punjab SDGs Plus Project, as a joint initiative of UNDP Pakistan and the Government of Punjab, is launched to strengthen a policy integration approach, evidence-based decision-making, resilient institutional capacities, diversified partnerships, mobilization of innovative financing, and integrating climate resilience, innovation, social protection and inclusion to provide a comprehensive ‘SDG Push’ in priority policy areas to help Punjab embark on a stable, sustainable, and accelerated trajectory of achieving the SDGs. The project is anchored by an integrated framework comprising three key areas based on the provincial priorities, including:

Objective 1: Internalizing SDGs: Improved governance for SDGs aligned equitable and inclusive development planning, budgeting, expenditure tracking, monitoring, and reporting, with a special focus on underdeveloped/marginalized districts to achieve regional equalization.
Objective 2: Financing for Development and Climate Resilience: Public and private financing for development, identifying and channeling resources to reduce the development financing gap, focusing on SDG investments and climate financing.
Objective 3: Inclusive Development, Social Protection, and Innovation: Gender equality, inclusion, innovation, and digital transformation mainstreamed in SDGs to achieve Leave No One Behind.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and inspiring stories.



UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.

UNDP is the leading United Nations organization, fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet.
 The Agenda 2030, based on a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is underpinned by a strong commitment to leave no one behind and to reach the furthest behind first. It recognizes the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and inequality and provides a framework that comprehensively addresses all dimensions of well-being. Pakistan was one of the first countries in the world to endorse the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the Sustainable Development Summit held on 25 September 2015. In 2016, Pakistan Parliament unanimously approved the SDGs as the national development agenda. Since then, Pakistan has demonstrated an impressive policy, institutional, and financial commitment to achieving SDGs, embracing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and leaving no one behind by adopting the UNDP-supported Goals frameworks as part of its national development planning. Since adopting the Sustainable Development Goals as the National Development Agenda, the Punjab Government took the lead in establishing the SDGs Support Unit at the Planning & Development Board in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme.
 As a second-generation intervention of the long-standing National Initiative for SDGs (2016-2023), the Punjab SDGs Plus Project, as a joint initiative of UNDP Pakistan and the Government of Punjab, is launched to strengthen a policy integration approach, evidence-based decision-making, resilient institutional capacities, diversified partnerships, mobilization of innovative financing, and integrating climate resilience, innovation, social protection and inclusion to provide a comprehensive ‘SDG Push’ in priority policy areas to help Punjab embark on a stable, sustainable, and accelerated trajectory of achieving the SDGs. The project is anchored by an integrated framework comprising three key areas based on the provincial priorities, including:

Objective 1: Internalizing SDGs: Improved governance for SDGs aligned equitable and inclusive development planning, budgeting, expenditure tracking, monitoring, and reporting, with a special focus on underdeveloped/marginalized districts to achieve regional equalization.
Objective 2: Financing for Development and Climate Resilience: Public and private financing for development, identifying and channeling resources to reduce the development financing gap, focusing on SDG investments and climate financing.
Objective 3: Inclusive Development, Social Protection, and Innovation: Gender equality, inclusion, innovation, and digital transformation mainstreamed in SDGs to achieve Leave No One Behind.

JOB SUMMARY
 The Officer, Accountable and Inclusive Programming (AIP) is responsible for ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place at the country level, and that they are being implemented across all programs to fulfill IMC’s minimum accountability standards, especially with regard to community engagement (including information sharing, beneficiaries’ meaningful participation, and feedback and complaints handling). This position is also responsible for ensuring protection mainstreaming mechanisms are implemented across all programs, ensuring that IMC programs are safe, accountable, and inclusive, and that these programs adhere to the four main principles of Protection Mainstreaming in all programs: 1) prioritize safety and dignity and avoid causing harm, 2) provide meaningful access, 3) ensure accountability, and 4) support participation and empowerment.
 The Officer, Accountable and Inclusive Programming will be responsible for day-to-day management of the country Community Based Feedback and Response Mechanisms (CBFRM) process. Additionally, this position may contribute to the development of country-level community information sharing strategy/plan, and facilitate complementary community engagement activities, providing meaningful opportunities for members of the affected population to make informed decisions about the assistance they receive. Furthermore, the Officer will also contribute to knowledge management and learning processes incorporating lessons learned and best practices from accountability to affected populations (AAP) activities, working closely with Program staff. Additionally, this position will provide regular reporting on feedback and complaints to the Manager, AIP and manage the country office’s CBFRM database.
 The Officer will support the country team’s protection risk assessment process and contribute to protection mainstreaming. Efforts to ensure that AAP and protection are mainstreamed across all stages of the program cycle will be done in collaboration with staff carrying out safeguarding initiatives across the organization.
 To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential function with or without reasonable accommodation.

Support the completion of complementary AAP analysis/assessments, including, but not limited to: stakeholder analysis, communication needs assessment, community consultations.
Support the implementation of gender analyses and gender assessments.



 Project Implementation


Ensure that AAP data is collected routinely throughout the project cycle (not just at project mid and endpoints, enabling corrective action).

JOB SUMMARY
 The Officer, Accountable and Inclusive Programming (AIP) is responsible for ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place at the country level, and that they are being implemented across all programs to fulfill IMC’s minimum accountability standards, especially with regard to community engagement (including information sharing, beneficiaries’ meaningful participation, and feedback and complaints handling). This position is also responsible for ensuring protection mainstreaming mechanisms are implemented across all programs, ensuring that IMC programs are safe, accountable, and inclusive, and that these programs adhere to the four main principles of Protection Mainstreaming in all programs: 1) prioritize safety and dignity and avoid causing harm, 2) provide meaningful access, 3) ensure accountability, and 4) support participation and empowerment.
 The Officer, Accountable and Inclusive Programming will be responsible for day-to-day management of the country Community Based Feedback and Response Mechanisms (CBFRM) process. Additionally, this position may contribute to the development of country-level community information sharing strategy/plan, and facilitate complementary community engagement activities, providing meaningful opportunities for members of the affected population to make informed decisions about the assistance they receive. Furthermore, the Officer will also contribute to knowledge management and learning processes incorporating lessons learned and best practices from accountability to affected populations (AAP) activities, working closely with Program staff. Additionally, this position will provide regular reporting on feedback and complaints to the Manager, AIP and manage the country office’s CBFRM database.
 The Officer will support the country team’s protection risk assessment process and contribute to protection mainstreaming. Efforts to ensure that AAP and protection are mainstreamed across all stages of the program cycle will be done in collaboration with staff carrying out safeguarding initiatives across the organization.
 To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential function with or without reasonable accommodation.
